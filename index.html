      Slow-cooked in our signature blend of herbs and spices, <strong>PhilippFloesser.com</strong> is a website perfect any occasion. It is home to an assortment of content including recent project showcases, various certifications I’ve received, and general biographical information. Currently, I’m a senior at Auburn University studying Supply Chain Management and will be graduating in May 2021. As such I am looking for full time employment opportunities to continue learning and further develop the skills I have gained from my academic and work-related experiences.

      Last fall I completed an internship in the procurement department of Powerteq (a high-performance aftermarket automotive company) but over the last several years I have done work ranging from web development to theatrical production. Needless to say, I like to keep an open mind and am always looking for new ways to grow professionally. If there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to avoid preconceived notions, because more often than not you’ll be pleasantly surprised by things which you need only give a chance.

      As of late my main occupational interest is data science, and I have been working on tailoring my skill set to combine the technical expertise of data engineers/data scientists with the operational expertise of supply chain, manufacturing, and other frontline managers. As we travel further into the information age, business acumen is increasingly tied to domains like big data, statistics, advanced computing, and visualization tech. I believe the greatest change will come from those with an ability to both see the big picture and “speak data”. By taking this interdisciplinary approach I hope to be at the forefront of innovation in my field.

      <h1 class="project-header">Project Showcase</h1>
        <h3>
          This project is based on a case study involving the allocation of medical linear accelerators (Linacs) to cancer treatment facilities in Ontario, Canada over a five-year period.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Linacs are commonly used in radiation therapy either as a curative treatment, to alleviate symptoms, or extend/improve quality of life. By customizing high energy x-rays or electrons to conform to a tumor's shape, the goal is to destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to the surrounding normal tissue. Approximately half of cancer patients require radiation therapy at least once during the course of their illness, many requiring repeat treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
          To meet the high demand for radiation treatment in Ontario, Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) launched a strategy which outlined recommendations for investments in linacs. A single linac can, on average, treat 426 patients per year. Several problems are associated with insufficient capacity: some patients may receive no treatment or may not receive it in a timely manner, patients may be required to travel to distant cancer centers at high personal cost, and some patients may be required to substitute other treatments that are not as effective as radiation therapy in their condition. Radiation therapy is often cost-effective but requires high initial investment. The capital resources and implementation timelines for the construction of new facilities were not realistic to meet current or near future demand. As such, CCO decided to fill current facilities before investing in new ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The facilities have three types of rooms: “treatment rooms” which are currently occupied by a linac, “empty rooms” which have been allocated for future expansion but aren’t currently in use, and “swing rooms” which are empty rooms typically used for equipment replacement. Once a linac has been installed it cannot be moved (excepting two portable linacs which CCO owns). Ideally empty rooms should be filled before swing rooms to maximize use of swing rooms for equipment replacement. Demand forecasts for radiotherapy were calculated based on the projected growth in cancer incidence across the province. Based on current system capacity, Ontario has a total of 16 empty or swing rooms that can potentially be filled with linacs over the next 5 years. Based on forecasted demand, the recommended allocation was as follows: 4 linacs in 2013, 3 linacs in 2014, 5 linacs in 2015, 2 linacs in 2016, 2 linacs in 2017. By 2018 CCO will run out of capacity and will require additional capital investments to build a new treatment facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal was to devise a strategy to allocate linacs to available rooms/facilities in a way that ensured quality radiation treatment to all patients across the province. In other words, I wanted to create a quantitative plan to meet demand, given the available resources and constraints. I determined the best route would be to optimize the ratio of patients per linac across all facilities (using Excel and an add-in called Solver) in order to provide an unbiased and data driven plan. Here are the results:
         </p>

        <iframe width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=1B95866A4A6C39BE%2110807&authkey=%21AEvyBJxaCKSqsvA&em=2&wdAllowInteractivity=False&ActiveCell='Starting%20Info'!A3&wdHideGridlines=True&wdHideHeaders=True&wdDownloadButton=True&wdInConfigurator=True"></iframe>

        <p>
          The first page shows both the starting information which was relevant for meeting my goal (in blue), as well as the final allocation plan (in green) based on the calculated results. You can see in the yellow columns on pages 2013-2017 how allocation was optimized to best meet demand for that specific year. At the bottom of each page you can also see the formulas I used in Solver to account for capacity constraints and set the goal.

        Outside of school and throughout quarantine I’ve been taking advantage of free online learning resources like Coursera and Brilliant. One resource which has been incredibly helpful is CognitiveClass.ai, IBM's Developer Skills program. Through it I've been able to earn professional certificates for successfully completing and passing courses like Data Science Methodology, Mathematical Optimization for Business Problems, and SQL and Relational Databases. They provide many more useful certifications and I recommend their courses to anyone with some free time and an interest in data science. You can see my earned certificates and badges below.
